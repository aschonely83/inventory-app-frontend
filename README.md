Inventory App is a single page application intended to be used as a way to keep track of retailers and how many pallets you have for them. You are able to add retailer, delete retailers and pallets, then also add pallets.

It uses a Rails API backend and a frontend consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
